== Welcome to Light Site CMS v. 0.1.0

Light Site CMS is easy to use Content Management System. There are no separate admin applications. 
All you need to edit content of your site is your site. 

== Getting Started

2. Create database and run migration.
3. Start your server and you are up and running.
4. Login to application using user/password: admin/administrator.

== Customizing Light Site

You can customize your site using standard CSS and HTML. Main layout is application.html.erb. You can add 
your custom layouts to app/views/layouts. Remember to register your new layouts in admin panel. Each 
layout can have multiple positions, where content can be added. To enable rendering elements to positions 
just add <%= yield :position_name %> add add this position in your admin panel. Main position can be 
paginated.

== Writing your own plugins

In config/initializers/light_cms_config.rb you can find some config mappings. Ckfinder.map enables 
your classes that uses attachment_fu to display images in wysywig editor. ExtensionManager allows to 
render partials into existing views, so you can customize plugins or write your own. Some elements 
don't have ExtensionManager suppert yet. If you need it just add this line where you need extension:
<%= ExtensionManager.render(:position => "element", :action => "action", :form => f, :view => self) %>
:form => f - is only needed when you want to extent some form. Currently there are two types of 
extensions:
